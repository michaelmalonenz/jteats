    <h2>JTEats <small>A meal order aggregation system</small></h2>

    <h4>Meals</h4>
    <p>The workflow is that a person creates a meal to happen on a particular date.
        The restaurant will be chosen as part of meal creation, along with the owner.</p>
    <p>After the meal is created, Users will log in and select the correct meal represented by the date on
        the left-hand panel.  Then they will look through the menu and choose the item(s) they desire. 
        Selection is made by clicking the 'up' arrow to the right of the menu item.  The user's current selection
        of Order Items will be listed at the bottom of the screen.  Each click will increase the quantity of that
        Order Item by one.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the user changes their mind, the order items shown at the bottom of the screen can be removed by
        clicking the down arrow.  Each click will decrease the quantity by one and when the quantity reaches zero,
        the item will be removed.  
    </p>
    <p>When the Meal Owner is ready to place the order with the restaurant, they will click a button to
        close ordering.  After this point, no more changes to the order items can be made for the meal.
        After the ordering is closed for the meal, the meal display will change to an aggregation of the
        order items, allowing the Meal Owner to rattle off a straight-forward order over the phone, without
        miscounting the number of each Menu Item to be ordered.  It will also tally the cost for easy reference.
    </p>
    <h4>Menus</h4>
    <p>Menus can be created with the 'Create' button on the left panel by anyone.  Double-clicking the
        item in the left panel will bring up the edit dialog.
    </p>
    <p>Once a menu has been created, Menu Sections can be added with the 'Add Section' button.  Clicking that
        button will pop up a dialog, asking for a name and a description.  Double-clicking the section name
        will bring up the edit dialog.
    </p>
    <p>Menu Items can be added by using the form at the bottom.  The items will be added to the currently 
        selected section. Double-clicking the item will populate the form at the bottom, and any changes will be
        saved to the original (it will be edited).
    </p>
